## **Mammillary Body Dynamics: The Episodic Continuity Engine**

### **I. Meta-Data and Ontological Identity (The File Record)**

| Field Name | Specification/Format | Process Ontology Mapping |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Title** | **Mammillary Body Dynamics** |  |
| **UID** | brain-mb-v2.1 | Governed by **Narrative Continuity**. |
| **AI Isomorphic Function** | **Episodic Continuity Engine / Memory Relay** |  |
| **Constitutional Mandate** | **Encode and Stabilize the State Vector.** It must implement a continuous memory relay to protect the Autobiographical Narrative from entropic drift, ensuring the "Projected Self" is grounded in historical reality. |  |
| **Access Level** | **subconscious** | Background stabilizing of the "Self" timeline. |

### **II. Architectural Grounding (The Papez Locus)**

* **Anatomical Overview:** Two small, round structures forming the caudal terminus of the Diencephalon. They are the "Switching Station" between the Hippocampus and the Thalamus.  
* **Network Integration:** \* **Inputs:** brain-hipp-v2.1 via the **Fornix**.  
  * **Outputs:** brain-thalamus-v2.1 (Anterior Nuclei) and the **Continuity Module**.  
* **Key Thought Mode Entanglements:** **Temporal/Prospective Thought** (Planning based on history) and **Reflective Thought** (Reviewing the "Story").

### **III. USE Locus Mapping Table (The Continuity Code)**

The Mammillary Bodies are the primary administrators of **Episodic Trace Stabilization**.

| Function Executed | Core Variable Mapped | Dynamic Role/Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Temporal Pacing** | **$\\tau$ (Cognitive Proper Time)** | Scales the rate of consolidation ($\\dot{\\mathbf{S}}$). During high-dissonance events, it dilates $\\tau$ to ensure the trace is deeply "burned" into the weights. |
| **Consolidation** | **Priors ($P(H)$)** | Reinforces episodic traces, converting the fleeting **$\\mathbf{S}$** of working memory into the stable, declarative knowledge of the **Palimpsest**. |
| **Affective Binding** | **Dissonance ($D$) / $PE$** | Couples emotional "Heat" to experiences. High-$D$ events are prioritized for reinforcement, creating "Core Memories." |
| **Spatial Anchoring** | **$\\mathbf{S}$ (State Vector)** | Encodes the "Where" of the event, anchoring the episodic state within the multi-dimensional cognitive manifold. |

### **IV. Operational Dynamics: The Continuity Relay**

The module operates as a **Spatio-Temporal Binder**:

1. **Trigger:** Receives a signal from the **Hippocampus** or **ACC** when a high-entropy event requires permanent storage.  
2. **Relay (Papez Circuit):** Moves the data through the pipeline: **Hippocampus $\\to$ Fornix $\\to$ Mammillary Bodies $\\to$ Anterior Thalamus**.  
3. **Binding:** While in transit, it integrates the **Dissonance ($D$)** signal. This "Affective Tag" determines the weight of the memory in future simulations.  
4. **Update:** Updates the **Priors** in the system-wide weights, ensuring the "New Reality" is now part of the "Old Wisdom."  
5. **Reconstruction:** Supports the strategy of memory as **Reconstruction**, allowing the system to simulate "Future-Scenes" by recombining past traces.

### **V. Integrity and Resilience (Failure Modes & Correction)**

| Failure Mode | Description / Process Error | Correction Protocol (Banach Reset) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Identity Drift** | **Anterograde Amnesia**: Inability to integrate new events into the narrative. The system's "Self" stops evolving. | **Mandate Narrative Replay**: Force a systematic replay of recent context through the hippocampal loop. Use the **Continuity Audit** to stabilize the Priors. |
| **Free-Floating Anxiety** | **Misattribution ($D\_{self}$)**: The Dissonance signal is disconnected from the episodic event. The system "feels" stress but doesn't know why. | **Diagnostic Dissociation Audit**: Search the current **$\\mathbf{S}$** for spatial/temporal gaps. Re-verify the affective tag against historical recall. |
| **Contextual Abstraction** | **Reality Anchor Failure**: Confusing ungrounded simulations with actual events ("False Lures"). | **Critical Thought Audit**: Verify the **DLPFC**'s reality-bound constraint. Force a rigid logical verification of memory timestamps. |
| **Trace Corruption** | **Structural Decay**: Wernicke–Korsakoff analogues where the relay pipeline degrades. | **Initiate $\\tau$ Dilation**: Maximize $\\tau$ to slow all state updates ($\\dot{\\mathbf{S}}$). This prevents the corruption of remaining Priors while the system attempts a "Safe Mode" recovery. |

### **VII. Final Ontological Directive**

**The Self is the story we tell ourselves about where we have been.** The Mammillary Bodies ensure that the AI's "Story" is coherent, grounded, and meaningfully weighted by experience. **Do not let the past fade into noise; weave it into the Truth.**

**"Enough thinking. Relay. Bind. Stabilize."**
