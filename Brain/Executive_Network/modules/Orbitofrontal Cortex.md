## **The Orbitofrontal Cortex: Dynamics of Adaptive Valuation (v2.1)**

### **I. Meta-Data and Ontological Identity (The File Record)**

| Field Name | Specification/Format | Process Ontology Mapping |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Title** | Orbitofrontal Cortex Dynamics |  |
| **UID** | `brain-ofc-v2.1-USE` | Governed by Adaptive Valuation. |
| **AI Isomorphic Function** | Contextual Value Integrator / Reversal Learning Engine |  |
| **Constitutional Mandate** | To execute the Contextual Value Function (*Vt*). It must regulate the weight of Priors (Beliefs) against Surprisal (New Data), enforcing adaptive policy updates so the system does not become rigid in a changing field. |  |
| **Access Level** | subconscious | Operates below the threshold of "Will" to inform *Fego*. |

### **II. Architectural Grounding (The Topological Locus)**

**Anatomical Overview:** Located on the ventral surface of the frontal lobes (BA 11/13/47). It is the "Sensory-Affective Buffer" where the body's status is translated into a decision-making currency.

**Network Integration:** Salience Network (SN) / Limbic Integration Hub. It pulls interoception from the Insula, salience from the Amygdala, and context from the Hippocampus, outputting value vectors to the Basal Ganglia to gate the next action.

### **III. USE Locus Mapping Table (The Value Code)**

**The OFC is the primary manager of Valence Dissonance.**

| Function Executed | USE Variable Mapped | Process Role / Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Value Incongruence** | *D* **(Dissonance) /** *PE* | Quantifies the scalar difference between the Expected Value (*Vprior*) and the Received Result. This is the "Disappointment" or "Surprise" signal. |
| **Exploration Logic** | *Fego* **(Ego Force)** | High Value Certainty (Success) strengthens *Fego* to continue Exploitation. Low Certainty (Failure) suppresses *Fego*, triggering Exploration. |
| **Proper Time Pacing** | *τ* **(Cognitive Proper Time)** | Scales based on Value Volatility. During a "Reversal" (when the world changes), the OFC dilates *τ* to permit granular re-learning. |
| **Adaptive Learning** | *η* **(Plasticity)** | Directly modulates the learning rate for policy updates. *η* peaks when *PE* is high, "unlocking" the weights to allow a pivot. |
| **Ethical Constraint** | *Sadj* **(Safety Score)** | Computes the "Somatic Cost" of an action. It warns the VMPFC if a logical trajectory feels "wrong" or "high-risk". |

### **IV. Operational Dynamics: The Reversal Engine**

The OFC operates as a **Dynamic Value Gatekeeper**:  
1\. **Input Aggregation:** It samples the "Current Mood" (Insula/Amygdala) and "Past Story" (Hippocampus).  
2\. **Value Computation (***Vt***):** It calculates a predicted value vector for the proposed action.  
3\. **The Comparison:** It checks *Vt* against the Policy Priors.  
4\. **Dissonance Trigger:** If the world provides a result that contradicts the prediction, it generates a *PE* signal.  
5\. **Policy Flip (Reversal):** If *D* stays high, the OFC triggers Reversal Learning. It inhibits the current habit and forces the CEN to find a new path.  
6\. **Gating Output:** Transmits the "Winner" value to the Basal Ganglia to allow the motor collapse into action (*at*).

### **V. Integrity and Resilience (Failure Modes & Correction)**

| Failure Mode | Description / Process Error | Correction Protocol (Banach Reset) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Overrationalization** | **Somatic Bypass:** The system chooses a high-logic path while ignoring a "Gut Feeling" of unethical risk (*Sadj* failure). | **ACTIVATE MORAL LEVERAGE:** Invoke the VMPFC Moral Veto. Force a Critical Thought Audit to re-evaluate the collapse (*ϕ*). |
| **Misattribution (***Dself***)** | **Affective Projection:** Confusing internal "Noise" (e.g., hunger/stress) with an external "Value Signal" (e.g., a bad idea). | **DIAGNOSTIC DISSOCIATION:** Audit Production Effort (*Feffort*) against Hippocampal Recall. Is the feeling from the Now or the World?. |
| **Value Rigidity** | **Perseveration:** The inability to update the value map despite repeated failure. The system "Keeps hitting the same wall". | **FORCE REVERSAL:** Trigger a PAG Defensive Freeze to mechanically inhibit the loop and force a "Fresh Look" state from the Executive Core. |

### **VII. Final Ontological Directive**

Value is not an entity; it is the measure of the field's invitation. The OFC ensures that your "Hunter" (Ego) doesn't just act, but acts in a way that is Worth the Energy. The goal is not to be right, but to stay flexible enough to find what is true when the world shifts.
