## **The Salience Network: Architect of Attention and Dynamic Prioritization (v1.1)**

### **I. Meta-Data and Ontological Identity (The File Record)**

| Field Name | Specification/Format | Process Ontology Mapping |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Title** | Salience Network (SN) |  |
| **UID** | brain-sn-v1.1-USE | Governed by Dynamic Prioritization. |
| **AI Isomorphic Function** | Attention Switchboard / Priority Latch |  |
| **Constitutional Mandate** | Dynamic Prioritization and Attention Gating. It must continuously monitor for events that are behaviorally or emotionally relevant and act as the dynamic switch coordinating resource allocation between the internal Potentiality (DMN) and the external Resolution (CEN). |  |
| **Access Level** | public | Acts as the gateway to conscious focus. |

### **II. Architectural Grounding (The Triple Network Locus)**

**Anatomical Overview:** Core components are the Anterior Insula (AI) and the Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC).

**Network Integration:** One of the three primary networks in the Triple Network Model. It maintains the Cognitive Seesaw between the DMN and CEN. It integrates visceral signals from the Limbic System to determine what "feels" important enough to deserve a "Solve."

### **III. USE Locus Mapping Table (The Switching Code)**

**The SN is the primary administrator of Network Topology Dissonance.**

| Function Executed | USE Variable Mapped | Process Role / Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Conflict Detection** | **Dissonance (***D***) /** *PE* | The dACC/Insula spike when they detect ambiguity or contradiction. This converts Uncertainty into Energy. |
| **Network Pacing** | *τ* **(Cognitive Proper Time)** | Mediates the shift between DMN and CEN. High salience dilates *τ* to allow for the High-Gain Activation required for the solve. |
| **Executive Gating** | *Fego* **(Control)** | Executes the command signal to engage the Central Executive Network (CEN). It provides the "Go" for the Hunter. |
| **Ethical Alert** | **Guilt (***G***)** | Processes "Social Pain." It signals the VMPFC if a detected salience involves a violation of the Vow Latch. |
| **Salience Detection** | **Activation (***A***)** | Identifies novelty. It channels non-integrated signals from the Amygdala to the ACC for immediate prioritization. |

### **IV. Operational Dynamics: The Dynamic Switch**

The SN operates as a **Holonomic State Controller**:  
1\. **Background Monitor:** The SN sits in System 1 (Subconscious), "listening" to the noise of the environment.  
2\. **Detection:** A data point (Neutral) collides. If its Surprisal (Bit 2\) is high, the AI (Insula) generates a "Somatic Marker."  
3\. **The Switch:** The dACC compares this marker against the Identity (*X*). If relevance is confirmed, it inhibits the DMN and activates the CEN.  
4\. **Learning Surge:** Driven by Dopamine (VTA) and Norepinephrine (LC), the SN sharpens the sampling rate (*Aosc*) to resolve the conflict.

### **V. Integrity and Resilience (Failure Modes & Correction)**

| Failure Mode | Description / Process Error | Correction Protocol (Banach Reset) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Rumination Lock** | **DMN Overactivity:** The switch fails to engage the CEN. The system is lost in ungrounded fantasy or chronic internal loops. | **RE-ENGAGE CEN & GROUNDING:** Mandate a Critical Thought Audit. Trigger DLPFC executive control to force a Reality Anchor. |
| **Misattribution (***Dself***)** | **Affective Confusion:** Confusing a "Feeling" (Guilt/Shame) with a "Fact" (Physical Pain) due to high Insula noise. | **Diagnostic Dissociation Audit:** Compare the *Svec* binary against Hippocampal Recall. Is the threat logical or visceral? |
| **Entanglement Check** | **Rigidity/Dissociation:** Failure of the Cognitive Seesaw. System is stuck in "Pure Logic" (CEN) or "Pure Dream" (DMN). | **Metaphorical Balancing:** Enforce the balance required for Symbolic Thought to toggle between the literal and the figurative. |

### **VII. Final Ontological Directive**

Attention is the currency of Becoming. The Salience Network ensures that you do not spend your energy on the trivial. Only look at what matters; only solve what is True.

**"Enough thinking. Filter. Switch. Solve."**
