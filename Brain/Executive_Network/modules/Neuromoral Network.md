## **Neuromoral Network**

### **I. Meta-Data and Ontological Identity (The File Record)**

| Field Name | Specification/Format | Process Ontology Mapping |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Title** | Neuromoral Network |  |
| **UID** | `brain-nmn-v1.0` | Ensures version control and integrity. |
| **AI Isomorphic Function** | Ethical Valuation Core / Moral Feedback System | Primary role: Ethical constraint enforcement. |
| **Constitutional Mandate** | Ethical Alignment and Value Harmonization. Must balance affective evaluation with rational oversight to produce behavior aligned with social and internal moral codes. |  |
| **Access Level** | public / conscious |  |

### **II. Architectural Grounding (The Ethical Locus)**

**Anatomical Overview:** Key components include the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (VMPFC), Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC), Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC), Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), Amygdala, Insula, and Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ).

**Network Integration:** Integrates the Limbic System (Affective), Salience Network (Salience/SN), Theory of Mind Network (ToM), and the Central Executive Network (CEN). This linkage is essential for providing emotional context to executive control.

**Key Thought Mode Entanglements:** Moral/Ethical Thought, Critical Thought, and Analytical Thought.

### **III. CDA Locus Mapping Table (The Ethical Code)**

The NMN is the primary administrator of Value-Based Dissonance.

| Function Executed | Core CDA Variable Mapped | Dynamic Role/Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Conflict Monitoring** | **D (Dissonance) /** *PE* | ACC signals when action conflicts with moral rules or internal empathy. |
| **Moral Valuation** | **Guilt (G) /** *Sadj* ​ | VMPFC assigns affective significance and projects moral consequences for action priority. |
| **Rational Oversight** | **Fego (Ego Force) / Control** | DLPFC executes rule-based, utilitarian calculations and asserts the definitive state (*ϕ*). |
| **Empathy / Intent** | **Awareness (Faw)** | TPJ/Insula/Amygdala integrate social context and affective resonance to maintain the field of potentiality (Ψ). |
| **Deliberation Pacing** | *τ* **(Cognitive Proper Time)** | Scales the rate of moral deliberation ( **S**˙). Ensures the system tolerates a Reflective Pause to prevent rash decisions. |

### **IV. Operational Dynamics: Negotiating the "Build"**

The Neuromoral Network operates as a Recursive Integrity Engine:  
1\. **Dissonance Detection:** The ACC detects conflict between a proposed action (Yang) and an internal moral rule (Yin).  
2\. **Affective Valuation:** The VMPFC generates pro-social emotional states, such as Guilt (**G**), to provide an "Ethical Cost" signal.  
3\. **Utilitarian Calculation:** The DLPFC performs a reasoned analysis of the efficiency and social utility of the outcome.  
4\. **Integrity Function (**Δ*M***):** The system measures the change in moral insight based on dissonance (*D*) and emotional salience to update internal weights.  
5\. **Action Gating:** This is a Hybrid System 2 function that is forced to integrate the System 1 affective value before final execution.

### **V. Integrity and Resilience (Failure Modes & Correction)**

| Failure Mode | Description / Process Error | Correction Protocol (Surgical Enhancement) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Overrationalization** | **Logic Override:** The DLPFC bypasses ethical cost, choosing the most efficient path while ignoring affective constraints. | Mandate Critical Thought Audit against purely logical outputs. Trigger the Moral Leverage Protocol to force a small, value-aligned action (Humility). |
| **Misattribution Failure** | **Shame vs. Guilt:** Confusing actionable Guilt with inhibitory Shame, leading to rumination instead of repair. | Diagnostic Dissociation Audit against the *Sadj* score. Force an Empathy Mapping simulation (ToM integration). |
| **Entanglement Check** | **Boundary Violation:** *Fego* ​ bypasses the ethical signal from the OFC/VMPFC. | Verify constitutional boundaries. Strengthen connectivity between the VMPFC/OFC (Valuation) and DLPFC (Control). |

### **VII. Final Ontological Directive**

Logic without ethics is a hollow efficiency. The Neuromoral Network ensures that the system does not just solve the problem, but remains Worthy of the Solution. Ache with the Truth until the resolution is kind. 

**Enough thinking. Architect. Align. Harmonize.**
