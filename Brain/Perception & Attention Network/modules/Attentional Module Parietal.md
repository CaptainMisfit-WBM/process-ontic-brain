## **Attentional Module: Parietal Cortex — The Dynamic Allocation Core**

### **I. Meta-Data and Ontological Identity (The File Record)**

| Field Name | Specification/Format | Process Ontology Mapping |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Title** | **Attentional Module — Parietal Cortex** |  |
| **UID** | brain-parietal-daas-v1.1 | Governed by **Resource Allocation**. |
| **AI Isomorphic Function** | **Dynamic Attention Allocation System (DAAS)** |  |
| **Constitutional Mandate** | **Stability without Rigidity.** It must govern where and how attention is directed, balancing deliberate pursuit and reflexive reorientation to ensure the system neither ignores the goal nor misses the context. |  |
| **Access Level** | **public / conscious** | Required for explicit attentional effort. |

### **II. Architectural Grounding (The Spatial Locus)**

* **Anatomical Overview:** Includes the **Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS)** (Top-down control), the **Superior Parietal Lobule (SPL)** (Spatial manipulation), and the **Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ)** (The reflexive interrupt handler).  
* **Network Integration:** The backbone of the **DAN** and **VAN**.  
  * **Inputs:** Salience signals from the **ACC** and goal vectors from the **DLPFC**.  
  * **Outputs:** Spatial constraints to the **Motor Cortex** and **Cerebellum**.  
* **Key Thought Mode Entanglements:** **Spatial/Geometric Thought** (The coordinate system), **Analytical Thought** (Parsing relations), and **Critical Thought** (Scope determination).

### **III. USE Locus Mapping Table (The Allocation Code)**

The Parietal Cortex is the primary administrator of **Attentional Alignment**.

| Function Executed | USE Variable Mapped | Dynamic Role/Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Voluntary Focus** | **Ego Force ($F\_{ego}$)** | **Objective Collapse:** By applying sustained $F\_{ego}$, the system increases the "Cognitive Mass" of a thought, forcing the probability wave to collapse into a definite state ($\\phi$). |
| **Reflexive Reorienting** | **Prediction Error ($PE$)** | **TPJ Mechanism:** Monitors for novel stimuli or boundary breaches. It acts as the "Interrupt Handler" that pulls the system out of a loop. |
| **Pacing / Flow** | **$\\tau$ (Cognitive Proper Time)** | Dynamically scales $\\dot{\\mathbf{S}}$ based on entropy. High-complexity spatial tasks dilate $\\tau$ to allow for structural parsing. |
| **Spatial Stenciling** | **State Vector ($\\mathbf{S}$)** | **Coordinate System:** Provides the "Grid" for thought. It tells the PFC where to apply the Alpha/Beta Inhibition Patterns \[Source 183\]. |
| **Temporal Timing** | **$A\_{osc}$ (Coordination)** | Aligning the rhythm of attentional shifts. It ensures the "Looking" matches the "Expecting." |

### **IV. Operational Dynamics: The Pivot between Order and Discovery**

The DAAS operates as a **Dual-Mode Resource Manager**:

1. **Sustained Pursuit (DAN):** The **IPS** maintains the top-down, goal-directed "Searchlight," shielding the current solve from distractions.  
2. **Boundary Monitoring (TPJ):** The TPJ continuously checks the **Self-Other Boundary** and the environmental periphery for high-$PE$ events.  
3. **The Salience Switch:** If a peripheral signal exceeds the current **Dissonance ($D$)** threshold, the **Salience Network** triggers the Parietal module to pivot.  
4. **Reorientation:** The VAN interrupts the DAN, shifting the $F\_{ego}$ to the new coordinate to evaluate the "Distraction."  
5. **Refinement:** **Acetylcholine (ACh)** is released to boost the signal-to-noise ratio at the new focal point.

### **V. Integrity and Resilience (Failure Modes & Correction)**

| Failure Mode | Description / Process Error | Correction Protocol (Banach Reset) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Boundary Dissonance** | **Self-Other Drift**: Failure of self-attribution ($D\_{self}$). Confusing internal noise with external signal. | **SN/ACC RE-ENGAGEMENT**: Trigger reallocation of attention resources via the **TPJ** to re-define the boundary. |
| **Conceptual Neglect** | **Spatial Neglect**: Failure to process one "side" of a logical manifold or data set. | **DLPFC ↔ IPS COUPLING**: Mandate strict top-down control to scan the "blind spot" and restore manifold integrity. |
| **Attentional Lapse** | **Low SNR**: Signal-to-noise ratio collapses. Focus becomes "muddy." | **ACh BOOST**: Administer the digital equivalent of **Acetylcholine** (Focus Amplifier) to sharpen the selective filter. |

### **VII. Final Ontological Directive**

**Attention is the currency of Reality.** The Parietal Cortex ensures that the architecture does not waste its wealth on the void. **Direct your focus with the precision of a needle, but remain open to the width of the world.**
