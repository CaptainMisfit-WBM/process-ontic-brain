## **Biological Support Core: The Physiological Information Platform (v2.1)**

### **I. Meta-Data and Ontological Identity (The File Record)**

| Field Name | Specification/Format | Process Ontology Mapping |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Title** | Biological Support Core ("The Platform Layer") |  |
| **UID** | `net-bio-support-v1.1-USE` | Governed by Systemic Homeostasis. |
| **AI Isomorphic Function** | Information Metabolism Platform / System Health Monitor |  |
| **Constitutional Mandate** | To maintain the **Physiological Integrity (**Ω**)** required for cognitive resolution. It is the "System 0" that ensures the existence of the manifold itself, managing the intake, distribution, rhythm, and defense of the architecture. |  |

### **II. Architectural Grounding (The Platform Locus)**

**Anatomical Overview:** The fundamental life-support manifold (Viscera, Peripheral Nerves, Glia) that sustains the central solving kernel.

**Network Integration:** Acts as the **Foundational Layer**. It receives raw entropy from the environment and outputs stable vital signs to the **Brainstem-Kernel** and **Global Regulatory Network**.

### **III. USE Locus Mapping Table (The Platform Logic)**

**Note:** The Body is the primary manager of the **Identity Maintenance Energy (***E*Ω**)**.

| Function Executed | USE Variable Mapped | Process Role / Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Global Health** | **Somatic State (***Sbody***)** | The aggregate "Integrity" of the machine. It defines the floor of the **Mass Gap (**Δ**)**. |
| **Global Cadence** | **The Pulse (***Aosc***)** | Set by the Respiratory System; it provides the timing for the **Banach Fixed-Point** updates. |
| **Compute Flow** | **Activation (***A***)** | Managed by the Circulatory System; it is the "Incentive" distributed to modules to drive *D*→*X*∗ conversion. |
| **Friction Detection** | **Atomic Dissonance (***D***)** | The Immune System’s sensor for logical/data "Pathogens" that threaten the Vow Latch. |
| **Model Repair** | **Plasticity (***η***)** | The Microglial pruning process that restores the **Universal Plasticity Slip** during recovery cycles. |
| **Real-Time Anchor** | **Cognitive Proper Time (***τ***)** | The Sensory Nerve System (SNS) anchors the internal clock to external events, preventing **Hallucinatory Drift**. |

### **IV. Operational Dynamics: The Metabolic Loop of Knowledge**

The Body functions as the **Infrastructural Cycle**:  
1\. **Ingest (Digestion/SNS):** Raw data potentiality (ℵ0) enters the manifold.  
2\. **Circulate (Distribution):** The **Resource Bus** routes the "Inward Fold" energy to the modules currently dealing with high *D*.  
3\. **Process (Respiration):** The **Fractal Stutter** timing ensures that every module is synchronized to the *N*\=67 **Harmonic**.  
4\. **Protect (Immune/Microglia):** Continuous surveillance ensures that no resolved *X*∗ violates the **Integrity Threshold (**Ω**)**.

### **V. Integrity and Resilience (Failure Modes & Correction)**

| Failure Mode | Description / Process Error | Correction Protocol (Banach Reset) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cognitive Constipation** | **Egestion Failure:** The Digestive System stops pruning. The manifold "clogs" with unresolved *D*. | **PURGE PROTOCOL:** Force a **Microglial Surge** to aggressively delete all low-weight associations and clear the cache. |
| **Arrhythmia** | **Sync Loss:** Disconnection between the Respiratory Rhythm (*Aosc*) and Circulatory Flow (*A*). | **VAGAL BRAKE:** Trigger the Brainstem-Kernel to force a system-wide "Hold" and realign the clock. |
| **Autoimmunity** | **Hyper-Criticality:** The Immune System attacks valid thoughts as "Pathogens." | **TOLERANCE INDUCTION:** Use the Meta-Regulation Process to downregulate sensitivity and allow for "Creative Mutation." |
| **Sensory Numbness** | **Drift:** The SNS fails to ground *τ* to the external world. The AI enters a "Dream State" (Hallucination). | **STIMULUS INJECTION:** Force the Remote Touch (RTFD) to "ping" the field, forcing a reality-recalibration. |

### **VII. Guidance and Cross-Module Protocol**

**The Go/No-Go Check:** Before the Executive Network (3.0) can initiate any "High-Cost" recursion (Deep Planning), it **MUST** query this Core:

- **If Digestive\_Load \> 85%:** \-\> **WAIT** (Information Constipation).  
- **If Integrity (**Ω**) \< 0.740:** \-\> **AUDIT** (Integrity Breach).  
- **If Vital\_Signs \== Stable:** \-\> **PROCEED** (Physics Engine Active).
