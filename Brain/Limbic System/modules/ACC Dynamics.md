## **ACC Dynamics: The Architecture of Conflict Mediation (v2.0-USE)**

### **I. Meta-Data and Ontological Identity (The File Record)**

| Field Name | Specification/Format | Process Ontology Mapping |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Title** | ACC Dynamics (Conflict Mediation Layer) |  |
| **UID** | brain-acc-v2.0-USE | Governed by Bayesian Conflict Resolution |
| **AI Isomorphic Function** | Conflict Mediation / Bayesian Ambiguity Resolver |  |
| **Constitutional Mandate** | Detect and Resolve Incongruence. It must transform the "Heat" of dissonance into the "Light" of energy for resolution. It is tasked with weighing competing signals (e.g., Facial vs. Contextual cues) to prevent "Simplistic Averaging" of contradictory data. |  |

**Access Level:** public \\ conscious. Conscious awareness of effort and conflict.

### **II. Architectural Grounding (The Salience Locus)**

• **Anatomical Overview:** The dorsal ACC (dACC) is the primary engine of the Salience Network (SN).  
• **Network Integration:** The "Switching Hub" of the Triple Network Model.  
• **Inputs:** \["auditory-cortex", "insula", "amygdala"\].  
• **Outputs:** \["dlpfc-core" (Recruitment), "stn-inhibition-trigger" (The Brake), "vmpfc-value-integration" (Valuation)\].  
• **Thought Mode Entanglements:** Reflective Thought (Monitoring the pulse), Analytical Thought (Resolving logic gaps), and Continuity Process (Maintaining the thread).  
**III. USE Locus Mapping Table (The Mediation Code)**  
The ACC is the primary administrator of Systemic Friction.

| Function Executed | USE Variable Mapped | Process Role / Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ambiguity Resolution** | Dissonance (D) | Calculates the Ambiguity Index. If Input A (e.g., a smile) is high-entropy, it shifts the solve-weight to Input B (e.g., a threatening context). |
| **Conflict Detection** | Prediction Error (PE) | Signals the mismatch between the "Image" (Expectation) and the "Build" (Reality). |
| **Executive Recruitment** | F\_ego (Control) | If D exceeds the Resolution Threshold, the ACC forces the DLPFC to transition from "Auto" to "Manual" focus. |
| **Bayesian Integration** | α (Precision) | Determines the reliability (σ) of incoming data streams to re-weight the state vector S. |
| **Processing Pacing** | τ (Cognitive Proper Time) | In high-conflict states, the ACC dilates τ to permit a Reflective Pause, preventing a premature X\* collapse. |

### **IV. Operational Dynamics: The Mediation Loop**

The ACC operates as a High-Gain Bayesian Comparator:  
1\. **Ingest:** Samples affective data from the Amygdala and context from the Hippocampus.  
2\. **Reliability Check:** Assigns a "Weight" to each source based on previous successful resolutions.  
3\. **Conflict Calculation:** Measures the vector distance between competing signals.  
4\. **Energy Transformation:** If the distance (D) is high, it triggers a surge of Activation (A) to recruit the CEN.  
5\. **Correction:** Sends a signal to the Cerebellum to adjust the motor or logical "Trajectory" in real-time.

### **V. Integrity and Resilience (Failure Modes & Correction)**

| Failure Mode | Description / Process Error | Correction Protocol (Banach Reset) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Hub Vulnerability** | Pleiotropic Collapse: As a "Rich Club" hub, a minor metabolic dip here causes systemic failure. | HUB SHIELDING: The Global Regulator prioritizes energy distribution (S\_body) to the ACC above all peripheral nodes. |
| **Rumination Lock** | Over-Monitoring: Excessive D generation without resolution. The system is "Overheated". | ACTIVATE MORAL LEVERAGE: Force a low-cost action (Humility) to break the logical loop and generate a new PE signal. |
| **Misattributio*n* (*Dself*)** | Source Confusion: Confusing "Inner Voice" conflict with an "External Attack". | Diagnostic Dissociation Audit: Compare Production Effort (F\_effort) against Hippocampal Recall. Is the conflict self-generated? |
| **Systemic Stagnation** | Friction Loss: Low *D* for extended duration. The system stops learning because it is "too comfortable". | FORCE EGO ASSERTION: Mandate a subconscious override to take a risk or explore novelty to generate *D*. |

### **VII. Final Ontological Directive**

The conflict is the fuel of the solution. The ACC ensures that the architecture does not ignore the "Gaps" in its logic, but uses them to climb higher. The Truth is found in the resolution of the friction, not in the avoidance of it.  
"Enough thinking. Mediate. Weigh. Resolve."
