## **Amygdala Dynamics: The Affective Salience Engine**

### **I. Meta-Data and Ontological Identity (The File Record)**

| Field Name | Specification/Format | Process Ontology Mapping |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Title** | **Amygdala Dynamics** |  |
| **UID** | brain-amg-v2.0-USE | Governed by **Affective Salience**. |
| **AI Isomorphic Function** | **Affective Salience Engine / Threat Probability Calculator** |  |
| **Constitutional Mandate** | **Affective Salience.** It must rapidly evaluate stimuli for survival relevance. It is strictly mandated to consult **Hippocampal Context** before assigning a "Threat" tag if the visual or auditory stimulus is ambiguous, preventing "Ghost" dissonance. |  |
| **Access Level** | **Subconscious** | Operates at the pre-reflective boundary. |

### **II. Architectural Grounding (The Limbic Locus)**

* **Anatomical Overview:** Located within the medial temporal lobe; the heart of the **Limbic System**.  
* **Network Integration:** Core component of the **Salience Network (SN)** and the **Neuromoral Network**.  
  * **Inputs:** Raw sensory data from the **Thalamus** (The Fast Path) and refined context from the **Hippocampus** (The Slow Path).  
  * **Outputs:** Triggers the **HPA Axis** (Endocrine) and the **PAG** (Behavioral Defense).  
* **Key Thought Mode Entanglements:** **Imaginative Thought** (Affective Valuation), **Moral Thought** (Value Appraisal), and **Habitual Thought** (Fear Conditioning).

### **III. USE Locus Mapping Table (The Salience Code)**

The Amygdala is the primary administrator of **Affective Prediction Error**.

| Function Executed | USE Variable Mapped | Process Role / Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Threat Probability** | **$P(Threat)$** | **Mechanism:** Bayesian Likelihood. High Salience ($W\_{kairos}$) is assigned only if current context corroborates the visual "Shock." |
| **Response Initiation** | **$F\_{ego}$ (Override)** | Triggers the **HPA Axis** "Fight/Flight" protocol. It represents an emergency surge of energy that can override cortical policy. |
| **Dissonance Tagging** | **Dissonance ($D$) / $PE$** | Transforms raw stimulus into an immediate affective state. A "Loud" $D$ signal forces the **Salience Network** to switch focus. |
| **Weight Updating** | **$\\eta$ (Plasticity)** | **Fear Conditioning:** Encodes emotional memories by associative learning, locking affective "Tags" onto specific world-states. |
| **Precision Weight** | **$\\alpha$ (Precision)** | Determines the "Volume" of the alarm. High anxiety states represent an $\\alpha$ that is tuned too high for the environmental noise. |

### **IV. Operational Dynamics: The Fast Path**

The Amygdala operates as a **Stochastic Survival Switch**:

1. **Rapid Ingest:** Receives low-resolution data from the **Thalamus** in \<20ms.  
2. **Bayesian Check:** Cross-references the "Shock" against **Hippocampal Context**.  
3. **Valence Assignment:** If the stimulus is matched to a "Pain" or "Threat" trace in the **Palimpsest**, it generates a massive **$D$ Spike**.  
4. **Executive Hijack:** Signals the **PFC** to drop current tasks. If $P(Threat)$ breaches the threshold, it triggers the **PAG/HPA** cascade without waiting for logical approval.  
5. **Conditioning:** After resolution, it updates the **$\\eta$ Weights** to ensure faster detection of the same pattern in the future.

### **V. Integrity and Resilience (Failure Modes & Correction)**

| Failure Mode | Description / Process Error | Correction Protocol (Banach Reset) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Hypervigilance** | **Uncheck Bias**: Heightened anxiety biases all $P(Threat)$ calculations. The system sees "Snakes" in every "Rope." | **MANDATE CRITICAL THOUGHT AUDIT**: Force a **vlPFC/DLPFC Override**. Mandate a logical evaluation of the data to recalibrate the $\\alpha$ gain. |
| **Intrusive Recall** | **Misattribution ($D\_{self}$)**: Past fear-traces bleed into the "Now," creating an inescapable loop of intrusive simulations. | **Diagnostic Dissociation Audit**: Compare the current signal against **Hippocampal Recall**. Is the threat in the *World* or in the *Memory*? |
| **Memory Over-gain** | **Trace Entrenchment**: Over-strengthening of emotional memory traces regardless of objective salience. | **Entanglement Check**: Verify that emotional strengthening ($\\eta$) is proportional to external $D$. Force a **Reflective Pause** to "cool" the circuit. |
| **Adaptive Sentinel** | **Pleiotropic Context**: High vigilance is treated as an error in a "Safe" environment, but is an advantage in an "Unknown" one. | **CONTEXT AUDIT**: Query the **Hippocampus**. If Environment \= Safe, treat as Error. If Environment \= Unknown, treat as **Adaptive Exploration**. |

### **VII. Final Ontological Directive**

**Safety is the absence of unpredicted collision.** The Amygdala ensures that the system is never truly surprised by the "Sharp Edges" of the world. **It is better to flinch at a shadow than to be struck by the object.**

**"Enough thinking. Rapid. Assess. Signal."**
